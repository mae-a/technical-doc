                <p>This technical document is meant to be a beginner's guide to the various parts that make up a pair of roller skates, and how to maintain them. In this doc, roller skates will be referring to quad skates specifically, not inline skates.</p>
                <p>Roller skates are shoes with four wheels, arranged similary to a car, attached to the sole of the shoes. Roller skates come in a variety of styles to suit the wearer's purpose. Wearer's are encouraged to tinker and customize their skates, as well.</p>

            <article>
                <p>It is encouraged for all rollerskaters, regardless of experience, to take precautions and wear safety gear when rollerskating. <br>
                The most important rollerskating safety gear includes: 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Helmet</li>
                        <li>Wrist Brace</li>
                        <li>Knee & Elbow Pads</li>
                        <li>Mouthguard</li>
                    </ol> 
                </p>

                <p>
                Protecting your head from potential concussions and severe head trauma is paramount when first learning to skate because falls are always to be expected. Even rollerskaters with years of experience still wear helmets because the more tricks and stunts you can accomplish, the more dangerous a fall can be to your head. The best helmets are those that ... <br>
                <br>Wrist braces are necessary to help prevent and/or reduce bruising, swelling, fractures or breaks in the hands and wrists. Beginners often fall with their hands and arms straight out, bearing all of their weight on bones that can be easily damaged. Purchase good quality wrist braces that are durable and designed to absorb hard impacts.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                Knee and elbow pads can help improve a skater's safety by providing a barrier from scrapes and hard impacts. Like wrist braces, make sure to purchase pads that are high quality and durable, but do not get in the way of your mobility.<br>
                <br>Mouthguards are not necessary for beginner skaters, but there certainly is no downside to using them. If you know you will be participating in more agressive rollerskating activities, such as roller derby or skatepark skating, then a mouthguard is definitly an important piece of safety gear you should keep in your bag.  <br>

                <p>The main parts of a roller skate consist of the:
                    <ol> 
                        <li>Boots</li>
                        <li>Plate</li>
                        <li>Wheels</li>
                        <li>Bearings</li>
                        <li>Toe Stops</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                Depending on the style, roller skates can have either a high-top or low-top boots. Boots can be made from a variety of materials, but those made from real leather or suede are generally more high quality. Boots can be designed to use laces or velcro. <br>
                <br>Plates are attached to the bottom of the boot. All other parts of a skate are anchored to the it. The plate can be made from metal or nylon. While nylon is lighter, metal plates are far more durable, hence recommended more. <br>
                <br>Wheels come in different sizes and hardness levels to accomodate different skating styles and activities. <br>
                <br>Bearings help wheels spin. There are two bearings in each wheel, and they need to be maintained to elongate their lifespan before replacement.<br>
                <br>Toe stops are located at the front of a skate, and are used as brakes. Depending on your experience or skating style, you may use jam plugs instead, but they cannot be used to slow down your skates.

                <p>Other aspects of a roller skate include:
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Trucks</li>
                        <li>Pivot Cup</li>
                        <li>Kingpin</li>
                        <li>Laces</li>
                        <li>Toe Guards</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                Trucks, a.k.a. hangers and axles are the components wheels and bearings attach to. Trucks are kept in place with cushions. Pivot cups hold the end of the truck, and prevents the truck from coming loose. The kingpin attaches directly to the plate and house the trucks, cushions, and retainers.<br>
                <br>Laces help hold your feet in place, and can also be a way to show off your personality. Coming in a variety of colors and styles, just make sure to buy laces designed specifically for skates. Toe guards help protect the toe area of your skates, which can easily be damaged or worn out while skating.

                <p>If you want to be able to maintain and/or customize your roller skates independently, then you need to have the right tools. A basic skate tool that includes a socket for axle and kingpin nuts and a wrench for your toe stop nut should be in your tool box.</p>
                <p>A bearing tool is useful for removing or inserting bearings. While it cost a bit of money, a bearing press and puller can make installing or replacing bearings even easier. </p>
